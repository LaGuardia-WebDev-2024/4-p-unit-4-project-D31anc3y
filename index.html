              <h3>Falsettos</h3>
              <p>
                The story centers on Marvin, who has left his wife to be with a
                male lover, Whizzer, and struggles to keep his family together.
                Much of the first act explores the impact his relationship with
                Whizzer has had on his family. The second act explores family
                dynamics that evolve as he and his ex-wife plan his son's bar
                mitzvah, which is complicated as Whizzer comes down with an
                early case of AIDS. Central to the musical are the themes of
                Jewish identity, gender roles, and gay life in the late 1970s
                and early 1980s

              <p>
                It's 1962 in Baltimore, Maryland, and quirky, plus-sized,
                teenage Tracy Turnblad has one dream: to dance on the “Corny
                Collins Show”. When she gets put in detention with the
                African-American students in the school, they teach her some of
                their dance moves, and her new found groove wins her a spot on
                Corny's show

                Set in the 1920s and based on real events, this satirical show
                follows wannabe jazz age stars who get their fame not just for
                their singing or dancing talent, but for committing murders that
                make sensationalized headlines all across the city of Chicago.

              <h3>Grease</h3>
              <p>
                <span class="lala"> Grease </span>is a 1971 musical by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. Named
                after the 1950s United States working-class youth subculture
                known as greasers, the musical is set in 1959 at fictional
                Rydell High School (based on William Howard Taft School in
                Chicago, Illinois) and follows 10 working-class teenagers as
                they navigate the complexities of peer pressure, politics,
                personal core values, and love. The score borrows heavily from
                the sounds of early rock and roll. In its original production in
                Chicago, Grease was a raunchy, raw, aggressive, vulgar show.
                Subsequent productions sanitized it and toned it down
